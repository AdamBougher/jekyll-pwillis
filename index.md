My name is Anna Klis, and I am an Associate Professor of Economics at Northern Illinois University.  

I am an applied game theorist. My fields include public economics, environmental economics, and microeconomic theory, with a focus on externalities and coordination.

### Background
I've lived in seven states, and I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Texas at Austin in May of 2015. My main studies focused on microeconomics and game theory, with some work in experimental economics, industrial organization, and formal theory in political science. 

Prior to doctoral studies, I graduated from the Georgetown University Walsh School of Foreign Service in May of 2010.  During my three years there, I studied International Economics, helped organize the Carroll Round conference, and took part in student theatre.  I was also a teacher, Program Director, and Country Coordinator of the Learning Enterprises program in Poland. 

Aside from researching and teaching economics, I enjoy video games, caving, opera, and science-fiction and fantasy novels.﻿
